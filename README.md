# House-Price-Predictor

## This Project is based on Machine Learning in which We calculate Price of the House using a Dataset and training it by using several Machine Learning Algorithms Like EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and SEMMA(Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) model.
## The Model takes several factors like lot size, Number of Rooms, Floors, Bathrooms etc and hence Predicts the Price with 95% Accuracy in USD.
